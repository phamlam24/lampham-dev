      <p>
        This website is currently, highly experimental, and more as a way for me
        to test tools. It might load very slow, break things, and change a lot.
        Here should be a changelog of the website.

      <p>
        I used SemVer for this, even though this is not a framework or a tool. It
        just feels right to use like that.
